# HearthStone Card Controller

"Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft" (a game by [Blizzard](blizzard.com)).

This is a web card controller so you can track which cards you have already drawn and which are still in your deck.
The interface is similar to in-game's interface. We hope that more people enjoy it.

Feel free to use the code on your projects or websites, just mention this repository

## How to use it

The program can be used [here](http://0tho.github.io/Hearthstone-Cards/) or you can put on your own server.

The program has 3 screens:

1: Class selector

  In this screen you choose your class from the 9 in game classes.
  If you already built a deck with this class, your old deck will be loaded.

3: Deck Controller

  In this screen you can select which cards you have already drawn during the current match. This makes remembering your cards a lot easier. We intent to add more features to this screen, like counting the remaining minion cards, speed cards and weapon cards.
