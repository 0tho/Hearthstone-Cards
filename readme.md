# HearthStone Card Controller

"Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft" (a game by [Blizzard](blizzard.com)).

This is a web card controller so you can track which cards you have already drawn and which are still in your deck.
The interface is the same as in-game's interface but the code can be used for any type of card game.
